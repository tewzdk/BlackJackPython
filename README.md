# BlackJackPython
This is a Exam Project made by Sidney Schultz for the 2019 summer exam in Python 2 class on KEA. 

# Description of the program
This program is is a game where a player will play against the computer in a blackjack game. 
You bid how much you want to wager on you winning, then the program will randomly give you some cards and you can chose between getting one card more or staying at were you are at. You want to get as close to 21 points without getting over, or else you will lose the match.
